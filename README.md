# Context-Managers
A Context Manager is built for safe file handling

Today, I explored one of Python’s most elegant and powerful tools — the Context Manager.

We usually use context managers while handling files:

with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
    
    data = f.read()
    
But today, I took it a step further and built my own custom context manager using:

__enter__() to handle setup

__exit__() to handle cleanup

✨ This makes file operations safe, clean, and error-proof.
